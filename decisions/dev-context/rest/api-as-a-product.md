# API as a product

When looking at APIs, the focus is mostly on the technical implementation, whereas the business perspective is often overlooked.
But exactly in the business context more and more services are being created.
Therefore, we need to understand our API as a product and not just look at it as a pure code base.
APIs are a valuable part of our business assets, as with APIs we generate the corresponding operating values.

## It's a product

Just like any other product (e.g. the OTTO web shop), our API has **consumers**, it is subject to **continuous development**, it strives for **high quality standards**, and **flexible delivery of features**.
In addition, an API needs to deliver value such as **efficiency and scalability**, a **flexible business model**, **shorter time to market**, as well as **lower development and maintenance costs**.

From a business perspective, every API transaction has a value, whether it is data generation, integrating with third-parties, or direct revenue generation.
We treat our API as a business value generator that gives API consumers a great experience to integrate with, while at the same time generating revenue.

## Product responsibility

With a product there comes responsibility.
Our API is developed by heterogeneous teams, but we want to provide our consumers with a homogeneous, easy-to-use API.
This needs orchestration of many bits and pieces that is a complex field of tasks.

To be successful with our API, we will establish a product owner position.
Skills of the following areas play an important role:

- Strategy (vision, target group specification, roadmap, revenue channels)
- Business functionality (business objectives, customer needs)
- Process (overall view, compliance with standards, API discovery/Dev journey)
- Implementation (uniform product, repeat consumption, automation, continuous development)
- Communication (feedback channels, stakeholder management, evangelizing API as a product)

The combination of these skills unite in a "Triade", as this is already common practice when it comes to product responsibility at OTTO.
With the decision for "API as a product" and the respective product ownership now being implemented into an existing organization, comes high communication and process effort, as we have to interface and handle various stakeholders and teams.
