# define and assign permissions by using scopes

Endpoints must define permissions to protect access to their resources.
Each endpoint must define at least one OAuth 2.0 scope using the defined [naming conventions](R000048).

## Granting permission to public resources

Resources can be classified as _public_.
This is in the responsibility of the resource owner.
The OTTO website can serve as a reference for public resources.
Data that can be accessed there without further login can be defined as public.

For example:

- Product data
- Deal of the day

However, even endpoints providing public resources [must be secured with OAuth 2.0](R000051).
To harmonize the access to public resources we defined the special scope `otto.read`, which can be used to secure those resources.

::: warning Important
Every resource that **cannot be clearly** classified as public has to be considered as private and is not allowed to use the `otto.read` scope.
