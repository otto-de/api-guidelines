We decided against relying on the combination of [`Last-Modified`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.29)/[`If-Unmodified-Since`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.28) headers for optimistic locking, because their date values only support a granularity of one second (see [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.3.1)). In a high-traffic environment like otto.de this seems to be way too coarse. For use cases where this granularity is still 'good enough', the `Last-Modified`/`If-Unmodified-Since` combination is still a valid option, thus only being mentioned as **SHOULD NOT**.

Contrary to Zalando's Best Practices we also opted against [`ETags` in result entities](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#etag-in-result-entities) and [Version numbers](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#_version_numbers), because we feel this purely technical data does not belong into business-centric response payload data.

This leaves us with using `ETag` header for concurrency control. For now (v1.0.0) we accept that clients need to do an additinal `GET` or `HEAD` roundtrip in order to fetch the current `ETag` value prior to using it in subsequent requests.

When using `PATCH` with `application/json-patch+json`, a server should answer with status code `409 Conflict` instead of `412 Precondition Failed` when the `test` operation failed, based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#section-2.2:

> Conflicting state: Can be specified with a 409 (Conflict) status
> code when the request cannot be applied given the state of the
> resource. For example, if the client attempted to apply a
> structural modification and the structures assumed to exist did
> not exist (with XML, a patch might specify changing element 'foo'
> to element 'bar' but element 'foo' might not exist).

> Conflicting modification: When a client uses either the If-Match or
> If-Unmodified-Since header to define a precondition, and that
> precondition failed, then the 412 (Precondition Failed) error is
> most helpful to the client. However, that response makes no sense
> if there was no precondition on the request. In cases when the
> server detects a possible conflicting modification and no
> precondition was defined in the request, the server can return a
> 409 (Conflict) response.
