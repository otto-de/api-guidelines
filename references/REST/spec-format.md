# API specification data format

Many of the API requirements imply the need to repeatedly provide API descriptions and documentation, or even building and updating corresponding SDKs.

Furthermore, we have to automate as much as possible in order to be able to keep up with all the changes by minimizing manual efforts.

In order to achieve this we need to use an appropriate specification format for our APIs.

## Machine-readable

A core requirement for the format is automation.
The machine-readable specification data has to be parsed, processed, and validated, meaning the data must use a structured text/markup language so that we can process them.

Some examples of **NON-machine-readable** data formats: `text`, `markdown`, `image`.

Some examples of **machine readable** data formats: `json`, `xml`, `yaml`, `toml`, `csv`.
Even JIT-enabled script languages could be used, like `javascript`.

## Multilevel structure

Because of complexity and the pure amount of metadata needed to describe an API, the format must provide the possibility to simplify the arrangement of data.
So different content can be: grouped (nesting), referenced (path), and reused (store/anchor).

Formats that **DON'T** support nesting: `csv`

Formats **DO** support nesting: `json`, `xml`, `yaml`, `toml`

## Mergeable

The way the OTTO API is published differs from the "one service, one API" style.
The OTTO API is composed of different endpoints where the endpoints are routed via a first-level path. For example:

- api.otto.de/customer: Route: /customer > Customer Service
- api.otto.de/product/12345: Route /product > Product Service

Every service provides its own specification data. We have to merge all the specs into one document which ultimately describes the OTTO API.

## Schema

It is not critical which transport format we are using, it is even easy to support all
structured text formats at once. But finally the data will arrive in the memory of the machine that processes it.

This means the data must be composed and all different specs from different services MUST apply the very same schema. Once chosen, it must be applied to all spec files.

Having the right schema is a critical point. The schema must cover all the requirements and provide enough possibilities to supply all the information we need in order to document, test, and provide the API to the clients.

There are several possibilities how this could be achieved:

- we define custom schema
- we use a proprietary schema
- we use an opensource schema

## Tooling

Creating an API specification should be as easy as possible so the schema should fit into a good, rich ecosystem with tool support, so we do not need to build everything from sratch.

## Support

The schema format we use should be well documented, and have broad community, so everybody can get support fast.
The onboarding process should be as short as possible.

## Extensibility

We have to apply OTTO specific processes to the specs, for example registering in the gateway, merging docs into a single document, etc. The schema must be extensible, so that we can define OTTO specific attributes in the spec files without violating the schema or breaking the ecosystem support.

## Well-known spec formats/schemas

- [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/)
- [RAML](https://raml.org/)
- [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)

Based on considerations we have to identify best possible solution for us.

## Comparison of the forementioned schemas

### API Blueprint

#### Pro

- leverages markdown, which is easy to write

#### Contra

- requires format-proprietary parsers
- not tansport-friendly
- merging could get difficult.
- also a mixture of descriptions and specs is very errorneous

### RAML

#### Pro

- based on yaml/json
- supports includes
- supports markdown descriptions

#### Contra

- poor tooling support for newer versions
- focus on modeling in early API lifecycle, i.e. it will likely need to be converted to other formats as the API matures
- no backward compatibility of versions
- development state is stale, due to low activity

### OpenAPI 3.x

#### Pro

- can be preprocessed and customized based on vendor extensions
- supports vendor extensions
- based on yaml/json, can be merged
- supports markdown descriptions
- supported by large companies such as Google, IBM, Atlassian, Microsoft
- supports various frameworks
- aims to be an API contract, a definition of what to expect from an API.
- actively developed, with rich community

#### Contra

- does not supports includes

## Decision

We choose to use [OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/)
We will extend it according to our needs by using vendor tags in order to describe
functionality we require.

By using this format we will benefit from the Work already done by Community,
what will minimize the efforts to adopt and use the format in production.

The open spec will allow us to build required tools in order to compensate missing
features like includes.
