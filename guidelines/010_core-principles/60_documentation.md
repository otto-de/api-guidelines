# Documentation

Our [quality standards](guidelines/100_core-principles/quality-standard.md) define all the values that are important to us.
What's more, we aim to take care of clearly structured documentation, provide our audience with code examples, and make sure they have a great time using our API.
Here's what that means:

## Clear structure

### Usability

* A user-friendly navigation makes it easy to discover the API and find all relevant information.
* The sidebar is cleary structured and easy to navigate.
* API endpoints and examples are shown in context.

### Getting started

* Basic information is available at one central place, such as info about HTTP methods, API operations, request/response headers, versioning, pagination, or errors.
* A short and simple guide provides an overview of the most likely tasks to perform with the API.
* Users can get in touch with us via a contact form.

### Tutorials

With step-by-step walkthroughs we'll cover specific functionality that can be implemented with the API.

### Familiarize users with the API

We'll cater for experienced users that already have an idea of the endpoints to be used, and at the same time provide the respective structure and information for inexperienced users who need a thorough introduction and/or example use cases.

### Discoverable and easy to digest

* All information is easily discoverable, easy to digest, and prepared in a way that the user can effectively work with it.
* We'll be consistent with our tone of voice, terminology, attribute names, API endpoint design, requests and responses, and counting.
* The layout supports accordingly, e.g. with syntax highlighting or multi-column layout.

## Code examples

### Default values

Request and response examples that belong to every endpoint documentation have meaningful default values that follow a specific story. 

### Code examples and attribute tables

Every endpoint documentation comes with examples and also provides a table listing the available attributes with explanatory text.

### Automated API reference documentation

API reference documentation is created and published automatically, see [MUST provide API specification using OpenAPI](link). TODO

## Consistency and accessability

* Documentation is provided in American English (EN-US), as US spelling has become the standard in APIs. Also endpoints, properties, and default values are provided in American English.
* Users can search the documentation.
* The sidebar is available at all times so that the documentation can be easily browsed. All the endpoints can be accessed via the sidebar.
* Code examples and explanatory text are visually separated.

## Efficient and refined

The API is well-documented and up-to-date.
Users can flawlessly integrate and are informed about recent changes via a revision history.
