# MUST collect external partner consent on deprecation time span

If the API is actively consumed, the API provider must define a reasonable time span that the API will be maintained after having announced deprecation.
All consumers must state consent with this after-deprecation-life-span, that means the minimum time span between official deprecation and first possible sunset, **before** they are allowed to use the API.
