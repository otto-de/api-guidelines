# Deprecation of obsolete API versions and components

Sometimes it is necessary to phase out an API, an API version or an API feature.
For example, a property is no longer supported, or a whole business functionality is supposed to be removed.
As long as consumers still use API features, removal of these is a breaking change and not allowed.
The following deprecation rules have to be applied to ensure that the necessary consumer changes and actions are well communicated and aligned using _deprecation_ and _sunset_ schedules.
The deprecation phase precedes the final sunset date.
