# SHOULD involve technical writer

Any description that has been provided by developers in the OpenAPI specification should undergo a copy editing and proofreading process by a technical writer.
As explanations may be too difficult for the audience to understand, may not be sufficiently described or may contain inconsistent terminology, all texts should be edited by a technical writer.
