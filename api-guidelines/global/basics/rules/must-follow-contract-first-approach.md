# MUST follow Contract First approach

When a new API is being developed, we follow the [Contract First approach](../../core-principles/contract-first.md).
This requires the following aspects:

- We define API contracts first before coding the implementation using a [standard specification language](../../../rest/contract/openapi/rules/must-provide-api-specification-using-openapi-for-rest-apis.md).
- We get early review feedback from peers and API consumers.

By defining API contracts outside of the code, we aim to facilitate early review feedback and a development discipline that focuses service interface design on a profound understanding of the domain and the required functionality.
