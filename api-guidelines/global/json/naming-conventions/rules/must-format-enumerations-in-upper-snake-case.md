# format enumerations in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

In order to easily distinguish between values and properties, it is best practice to write enumerations in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE format.

DO

````json
{
    "eventType": "EMAIL",
    "clientStatus": "STOPPED_AFTER_ERROR"
}
````

DON'T

````json
{
    "eventType": "Email",
    "clientStatus": "stoppedAfterError"
}
````
