# API design

API design involves many aspects such as architectural styles, API governance, backend capabilities, performance, and such.
There are many constraints and compromises to be considered.
With our API design we want to create value for the customer and provide a good developer experience.

## REST APIs

For our REST APIs, we've decided to apply the RESTful principle to all kind of application components.
REST resources are identified via URIs and can be manipulated via standardized CRUD operations using different representations, and hypermedia.
RESTful APIs come with less rigid client/server coupling and are more suitable for an ecosystem of (core) services providing a platform of APIs to build diverse business services.

In summary:

- We prefer REST-based APIs with JSON payloads.
- We prefer systems to be truly RESTful.

## Asynchronous APIs

With our asynchronous APIs, we aim for low coupling between services, i.e. to remove the need for services to actively send queries via synchronous APIs.
This reduces latency and simplifies changing services in insolation.
By using events, we provide a mechanism, that allows consumers to subscribe to events of their interest, whereas we use commands for actions to be executed by a specific recipient.
