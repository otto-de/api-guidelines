# Documentation

We strive to make API implementation a breeze with meaningful, easy-to-understand documentation.
This includes, but is not limited to:

- [Accessibility and usability](#accessibility-and-usability)
- [Code examples](#code-examples)
- [Context and walkthroughs](#context-and-walkthroughs)
- [Up-to-dateness](#up-to-dateness)

## Accessibility and usability

- We provide access to all API endpoints in a central location, some sort of documentation portal at the best, to ensure that users can easily use the API.
- The documentation is browsable across all available endpoints.
- A well-structured navigation ensures that the documentation can be navigated.
- We give users the chance to get in touch with us.
- All information is easily discoverable, easy to digest, and prepared in a way that users can effectively work with it.
- We are consistent with our tone of voice, terminology, attribute names, API endpoint design, requests and responses, and counting.
- The layout supports usability accordingly, e.g. with syntax highlighting or multi-column layout.

## Code examples

- Every endpoint documentation comes with examples and also provides schemas listing the available attributes with explanatory text.
- Request and response examples that belong to every endpoint documentation have meaningful default values that in the best case follow a specific story.
- API reference documentation is created and published automatically, see [MUST provide API specification using OpenAPI](../../rest/contract/openapi/rules/must-provide-api-specification-using-openapi-for-rest-apis.md).

## Context

- We give context for API usage such as information about HTTP methods, API operations, request and response headers, versioning, pagination, or errors.
- We cater for experienced users that already have an idea of the endpoints to be used and at the same time provide the respective structure and information for inexperienced users who need a thorough introduction, example use cases, or both.

## Up-to-dateness

- The API is well-documented and up-to-date.  
- Users can integrate easily and keep up-to-date with the latest API changes.
