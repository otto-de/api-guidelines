# SHOULD develop UI first, API second

While the development of additional endpoints is crucial to establish a comprehensive and vital API ecosystem, we do not want to build endpoints upfront without the appropriate use cases.
In a first step, you should focus on implementing an appropriate UI to identify the requirements and quality factors of the API.
Only in a second step, we provide an API, that is suitable to implement more clients, having similar requirements as the first UI use case.
