# MUST filter consumed events by `type`

Event consumers must filter consumed events by the `type` context attribute to ensure that they don't break when an event producer writes a [new event type version with incompatible changes](/guidelines/r200014) on a subscribed channel (i.e., topic/queue).

If the event producer guarantees that the subscribed channel only contains the required event type and will _never_ contain another event type, event consumers do not need to filter.
