# provide event `time` in UTC

The [`time`](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#time) context attribute must be provided in [date-time](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) format in the UTC timezone. Using a common timezone and format makes it easier to sort events only by interpreting the string representation.

If the `time` context attribute does not contain the timestamp of when the event happened, API providers must explicitly document this in the API specification.

Example of an UTC timestamp:

```text
1990-12-31T23:59:60Z
```
