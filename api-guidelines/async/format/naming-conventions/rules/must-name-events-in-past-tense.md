# MUST name events in past tense

Events must be named in past tense to clearly communicate that the event has happened in the past.

This makes it easier to distinguish messages between commands and events just by their name:

- `PaymentProcessed` Past tense, therefore an event
- `ProcessPayment` Present tense, therefore a command
