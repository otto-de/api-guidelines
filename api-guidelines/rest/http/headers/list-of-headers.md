# List of headers

::: accordion Headers

The list of headers is not supposed to be exhaustive, but contains the most common headers used in the context of the API.
We do not prohibit the use of headers that are not listed below.
HTTP/1.1-related headers, for example, `Connection`, are not explicitly listed.

| Header Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Part of Request | Part of Response |
