# MUST specify success and error responses

APIs should define the functional, business view and abstract from implementation aspects.
Success and error responses are a vital part to define how an API is used correctly.

Therefore, you must define **all** success and service specific error responses in your API specification.
Both are part of the interface definition and provide important information for service clients to handle standard as well as exceptional situations.

In most cases it is not useful to document all technical errors, especially if they are not under control of the service provider. Thus, unless a response code conveys application-specific functional semantics or is used in a non-standard way that requires additional explanation, multiple error response specifications can be combined using the following pattern:

See [Error Handling](/guidelines/rest-guidelines/errors#error-handling) for more details.

```yaml
responses:
  ...
  default:
    description: error occurred - see status code and problem object for more information.
    content:
      "application/problem+json":
        schema:
          $ref: 'https://api.otto.de/problem/schema.yaml#/Problem'
```

API designers should also think about a **troubleshooting board** as part of the associated online API documentation.
It provides information and handling guidance on application-specific errors and is referenced via links from the API specification.
This can reduce service support tasks and contribute to service client and provider performance.
