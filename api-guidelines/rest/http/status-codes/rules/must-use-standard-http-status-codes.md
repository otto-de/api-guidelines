# MUST use standard HTTP status codes

You must only use standardized HTTP status codes consistently with their intended semantics.
You must not invent new HTTP status codes.

RFC standards define ~60 different HTTP status codes with specific semantics (mainly [RFC7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6) and [RFC 6585](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585)) â€” and there are upcoming new ones, for example, [draft legally-restricted-status](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tbray-http-legally-restricted-status-05).
Refer to the overview of all error codes at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) or via <https://httpstatuses.com/)> also including 'unofficial codes', for example, used by popular web servers like Nginx.

Below we list the most commonly used and best understood HTTP status codes, consistent with their semantic in the RFCs.
APIs should only use these to prevent misconceptions that arise from less commonly used HTTP status codes.

::: warning Important
As long as your HTTP status code usage is well covered by the semantic defined here, you should not describe it to avoid an overload with common sense information and the risk of inconsistent definitions. Only if the HTTP status code is not in the list below or its usage requires additional information aside the well defined semantic, the API specification must provide a clear description of the HTTP status code in the response.

| `422 Unprocessable Entity`   | Indicates a logically invalid request body. The server understands the content type of the request entity and the syntax is correct. However, the server was unable to process the contained instructions, for example, due to an inappropriate server state. | `POST`,`PUT`,`PATCH`,`DELETE` |
| `428 Precondition Required`  | Server requires the request to be conditional, e.g. to make sure that the "lost update problem" is avoided (refer to [SHOULD consider to support `ETAG` together with If-Match/If-None-Match header](/guidelines/r000060)).                                   | `<all>`                       |
| `429 Too Many Requests`      | The client does not consider rate limiting and sent too many requests (refer to [MUST use code 429 with headers for rate limits](/guidelines/r000014)).                                                                                                       | `<all>`                       |
