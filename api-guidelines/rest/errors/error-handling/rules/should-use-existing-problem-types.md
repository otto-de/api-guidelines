# SHOULD use existing problem types

In addition to the [predefined types](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457#section-4.2) in RFC9457, we have defined
the problem type [https://api.otto.de/portal/problems/validation-failed](./must-use-extension-for-input-validation-errors.md).

We encourage API designers to reuse existing problem types instead of creating completely new or slightly modified ones.

If none of the existing error types match the semantics of the problem, [defining a new problem type](./may-add-custom-extensions-by-defining-a-problem-type.md) is a feasible option.
