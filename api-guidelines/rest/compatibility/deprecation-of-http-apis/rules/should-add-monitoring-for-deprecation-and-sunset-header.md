# SHOULD add monitoring for `Deprecation` and `Sunset` header

Consumers should monitor the `Deprecation` and `Sunset` headers in HTTP responses to get information about future sunset of APIs and API features (see [SHOULD add `Deprecation` and `Sunset` header to responses](/guidelines/r000069)).
We recommend that API providers build alerts on this monitoring information to ensure alignment with API consumers on the required migration task.
