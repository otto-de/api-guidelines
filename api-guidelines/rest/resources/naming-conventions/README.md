# Naming conventions

When resources are well-named, an API is intuitive and easy to use.
If resources are poorly named, the same API can feel difficult to use and understand.
Having a strong and consistent strategy for naming REST resources results in an easy-to-understand API that developers enjoy working with.
To make our API as easy to use as possible in this section, we define our URI naming conventions.
