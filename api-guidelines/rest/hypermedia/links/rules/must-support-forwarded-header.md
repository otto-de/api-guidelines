# MUST support `Forwarded` header

In order to support proxies in front of your origin server, you must implement support for the `Fowarded` request header.

The `Forwarded` header is defined in [RFC 7239](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239) for identifying e.g. the original host (and port) requested by the client in the `Host` HTTP request header or the specified protocol.
Consult [RFC 7239, Section 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239#section-4) for examples of this header.

[Absolute URLs](/guidelines/r100032) rendered in links of a HAL response contain the value of this header.
