# Links

Hypermedia links embedded in an HTTP response allow API providers to communicate dynamic facts, such as business rule outcomes, to consumers independent of any static OpenAPI interface documentation.

This means that the reasons for these facts do not need to be explicitly stated in the static documentation and therefore do not need to be implemented by consumers. In addition, consumers are not dependent on them, which makes any change much easier.
