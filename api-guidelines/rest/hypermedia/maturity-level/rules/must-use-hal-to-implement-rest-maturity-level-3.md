# use HAL (Hypertext Application Language) to implement REST maturity level 3

::: info Info
This rule applies to APIs that have to comply with [REST maturity level 3](@guidelines/R000033).
:::

Since a variety of hypermedia formats exists, we decided to use HAL when a hypermedia implementation is required for the following reasons:

- The simplicity compared to other formats ensures quick familiarization with the format.
- Every `application/json` entity is a valid `application/hal+json` entity. This gives us the possibility to start with any given JSON API and later decide to add hyperlinks and embedded resources in a non-breaking way.
