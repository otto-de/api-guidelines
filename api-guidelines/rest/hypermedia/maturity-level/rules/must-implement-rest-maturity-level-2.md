# MUST implement REST maturity level 2

For all our APIs, we strive for a good implementation of [REST Maturity Level 2](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level2) as it enables us to build resource-oriented APIs that make full use of HTTP methods and status codes.
This is reflected in many rules of our guidelines, such as:

- [MUST use nouns to represent resources](/guidelines/r000016)
- [MUST use HTTP methods correctly](/guidelines/r000007)
- [MUST use standard HTTP status codes](/guidelines/r000012)

Although this is not HATEOAS, it should not prevent you from designing proper link relations in your APIs.

If you do so, you should use application/hal+json as representation format, because:

- Later publication of the API will be easier if HAL is used from the beginning.
- Implementing API clients is easier if different parts of the API behave the same and if the same format is used for different purposes.
