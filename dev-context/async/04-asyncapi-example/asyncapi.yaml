    ## OTTO Guideline compatible API spec

    This spec has the following features:
     - JSON schema is kept separate from the AsyncAPI spec.
     - Traits are used to define the common CloudEvent header.
     - Applies OTTO naming conventions.
     - Documentation of Kafka security measures.
     - Versioning of incompatible changes

    It uses a simple fictional example of an account service that emits the
    following events:
     - `de.otto.events.account-management.account.created.v1`
     - `de.otto.events.account-management.account.blocked.v1`
     - `de.otto.events.account-management.account.unblocked.v1`
     - `de.otto.events.account-management.account.deleted.v1`
     - `de.otto.events.account-management.account.created.v2` -- incompatible change
     - `de.otto.data.account-management.account.v1`
     - `de.otto.data.account-management.account.v2` -- incompatible change
