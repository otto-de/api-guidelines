# API as a product

When looking at APIs, the focus is mostly on the technical implementation, whereas the business perspective is often overlooked.
But exactly in the business context more and more services are being created.
Therefore, we need to understand our API as a product and not just look at it as a pure code base.
Just like any other product, our API has consumers, it is subject to continuous development, it strives for high quality standards, and flexible delivery of features.
In addition, an API needs to deliver value such as efficiency and scalability, a flexible business model, shorter time to market, as well as lower development and maintenance costs.

From a business perspective, every API transaction has a value, whether it is data generation, integrating with third-parties, or direct revenue generation.
We treat our API as a business value generator that gives API consumers a great experience to integrate with, while at the same time generating revenue.

Hence, the design of our APIs is based on the "API as a product" principle:

- Our API is a product and we are responsible for it.
- We provide our consumers with a homogeneous, easy-to-use API.
- We advocate for our user's needs.
- We actively improve and maintain API consistency.
