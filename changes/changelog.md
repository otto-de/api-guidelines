<!--CHANGELOG-MARKER-->
## 2023-07-12


## 2023-06-23
### Removal

The following rules have been removed as this is consumer-facing content and already available in the REST API sections "Getting started" and "About the API".

- MUST use Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for mobile and JavaScript apps
- MUST NOT use Implicit Grant flow
- MUST set user agent request header
- SHOULD use Accept and Content-Type headers with profile parameter

## 2023-06-20
### Update

- Changed test extension of rule "MAY use test extension [R200021](../api-guidelines/async/format/test-extension/rules/may-use-test-extension.md)" to allow additional test types.
- Changed the example that did not contain the correct test type.


## 2023-05-16

### Update

- Adjusted sidebar entries to resolve general guidelines into rest and async sections.

## 2023-03-09

### Update

- Profile and link relation URLs can be independent of the API Portal.
- Renamed the rule "MUST use absolute URLs for custom link relation types" to "MUST use absolute URIs for custom link relation types [R100037](../api-guidelines/rest/hypermedia/link-relation-types/rules/must-use-absolute-uris-for-custom-link-relation-types.md)". The requirement for a `https://api.otto.de/portal` prefix has been removed, and it is no longer required to provide resolvable link relation URIs.
- Merged the "Profile" section previously being found in "Hypermedia" into the section ["Versioning of incompatible changes"](../api-guidelines/rest/compatibility/versioning-of-incompatible-changes/README.md), because profiles are used for versioning of hypermedia and non-hypermedia APIs.
- Renamed the rule "MUST use profiles for Public REST APIs" to "MUST use profiles for versioning [R000065](../api-guidelines/rest/compatibility/versioning-of-incompatible-changes/rules/must-use-profiles-for-versioning.md)" to better indicate the purpose of profiles. The content describing the concept of a profile in depth has been moved from the section "Profiles" to this rule. Added further descriptions and examples to better highlight how to leverage profiles.
- Moved the rule "MUST use resolvable profile URLs (R100066)" to ["Versioning of incompatible changes"](../api-guidelines/rest/compatibility/versioning-of-incompatible-changes/README.md) and renamed it to "MUST use absolute URIs for profiles [R100066](../api-guidelines/rest/compatibility/versioning-of-incompatible-changes/rules/must-use-absolute-profile-uris.md)". The requirement for a `https://api.otto.de/portal` prefix for profile URIs has been removed, and it is no longer required to provide resolvable profile URIs.
- Removed the rule "MAY use type and profile attributes in hyperlinks (R100063)", because the cardinality of the profile link may change and profile URIs are no longer resolvable.
- Removed the rule "MUST use kebab-case profile URIs" as it is a duplicate of rule "MUST use kebab-case for URIs [R000023](../api-guidelines/rest/resources/naming-conventions/rules/must-use-kebabcase-for-uris.md)".
- Removed the rule "SHOULD NOT use resource versioned path" as it is a duplicate of rule "SHOULD NOT use URI versioning [R000026](../api-guidelines/rest/compatibility/versioning-of-incompatible-changes/rules/should-not-use-uri-versioning.md)".

## 2023-03-03

### Update

- Adjusted rules "MUST use common paging query parameters [R100024](../api-guidelines/rest/resources/collection-resources/rules/must-use-common-paging-query-parameters.md)"  and "MUST provide metadata for offset-based pagination [R100025](../api-guidelines/rest/resources/collection-resources/rules/must-provide-metadata-for-offset-based-pagination.md)" to use also `limit` and `offset` as query parameters.

## 2023-01-27

### Update

- Fixed the displayed name of the link in rule "SHOULD use existing problem types [R000037](../api-guidelines/rest/errors/error-handling/rules/should-use-existing-problem-types.md)".

## 2023-01-25

### Update

- Changed the type of validation error in rule "MUST use `problem+json` extension for input validation errors (R000038)".

## 2023-01-09

### Update

- Moved rule "SHOULD NOT use external identifiers as primary resource identifiers [R100077](../api-guidelines/rest/resources/naming-conventions/rules/should-not-use-external-identifier-as-primary-resource-identifier.md)" to the section [Naming conventions](../api-guidelines/rest/resources/naming-conventions/README.md).

## 2022-12-13

### Update

- Aligned problem+json rules to the RFC.
- Removed "key" and enforced a more sensible usage of the "type" property in rule "MUST use `problem+json` as error response format [R000034](../api-guidelines/rest/errors/error-handling/rules/must-use-problem-json-as-error-response-format.md)".
- Reworked rule "SHOULD use existing problem types [R000037](../api-guidelines/rest/errors/error-handling/rules/should-use-existing-problem-types.md)" to point to ValidationError documentation. Mention that `about:blank` should be used for problems that do not add any semantics to the status code.
- Reworked rule "MAY add custom extensions by defining a problem `type`(R000040)" to clearly state that a resolvable type documentation is not required. The type is primarily used as an identifier, as stated in the RFC. Added an example of a type documentation. Clearly stating that a context-specific type can be introduced.
- Fixed rule "MUST use `problem+json` extension for input validation errors (R000038)" so that the table is displayed again. Changed so that only status 400 is allowed for ValidationError to comply with the RFC that states that only one status is associated with a type.

## 2022-12-09

### Update

- Clarified that `datacontenttype` only needs to be provided if a media type is defined in rule "MUST provide `datacontenttype` context attribute if media type is defined [R200013](../api-guidelines/async/format/cloudevents/rules/must-provide-datacontenttype-context-attribute-if-media-type-is-defined.md)".
